Description: 
- An interactive web application that allows users to paint via pixel-art style canvas, and save that
  canvas to the server with a name. 
- Complete with menu UI that lists all canvases by their saved names, in which users can choose to
  load a certain saved canvas to continue editing the canvas or delete it from the list. 

------------------
Tutorial: 
- Users paint by first clicking on a quadrant of the blank canvas, then they can choose one of 3 actions:
    1. Divide: divide the selected quadrant into four sub-quadrants
    2. Merge: merge the selected quadrant with its 3 neigboring quadrants
    3. Color: fill the selected quadrant with a color (chosen from a drop-down menu)
       
YouTube DEMO of app: WORK IN PROGRESS

-------------------

TODO (so far):
- beautify the UI
- make a YT tutoria/demo
