YouTube DEMO of app: WORK IN PROGRESS

Description: 
- An interactive web application that allows users to paint via pixel-art style canvas, and save that
  canvas to the server with a name. 
- Complete with menu UI that lists all canvases by their saved names, in which users can choose to
  load a certain saved canvas to continue editing the canvas or delete it from the list.

TODO (so far):
- beautify the UI
- make a YT tutoria/demo
